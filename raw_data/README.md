See in the cube surface points folder.

Only data under label Q0, Qx, Qy, Qz , Tx, Ty, Tz are useful, discard other data.

Suppose there is a quaternion *q = ax + by + cz + w*

Q0=w

Qx=a

Qy=b

Qz=c

Tx ,Ty, Tz stands for the position of the probe's center in the sensor coordinate system

We are using the Aurora 5DOF tracker, so the Qz will always be zero and it has nothing to do with our result.
